This is the website of The Brunswick Foundation Sons &amp; Daughters Scholarship Program and The Brunswick Dealers Sons &amp; Daughters Scholarship Program Administered by Charitable Management Systems, Inc (&quot;Program Administrators&quot;)</p><p>552 S Washington Street <br/>Suite 202 <br/>Naperville, IL  60540 <br/>We can be reached via e-mail at info@brunswickscholarships.com or you can call us at 630-428-2412.</p><h2>What we collect</h2><p>We may collect the following information:<br/>(i) &quot;Personal Information&quot; – that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, and date of birth/age;<br/>(ii) &quot;Non-Personal Information&quot; – that is, information about you or your activities through which you cannot be personally identified;<br/>(iii) &quot;Application Information&quot; – that is, information related to a scholarship application (e.g., for The Brunswick Foundation Sons and Daughters Scholarship Program or The Brunswick Dealers Sons and Daughters Scholarship Program) which includes both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information of scholarship applicants, their parents/legal guardians, school officials, and others (e.g., information included on the scholarship application, Employee Verification Form, Transcript Form, Reference Form and other related forms); and/or<br/>(iv) Information related to customer surveys, promotions, and/or offers which may be Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information (e.g., preferences, demographics, interests, etc.).<br/>In situations where it is possible to do so, Non-Personal Information (as well as publicly available information) may be linked to Personal Information. We may collect Personal and Non-Personal information from users of the Scholarship Web Site. We may also obtain such information from third parties.</p><h2>What we do with the information we gather</h2><p> We require the information that we gather for various reasons including the following: (i) to administer and conduct scholarship programs (e.g., to identify potential scholarship recipients and to provide scholarship-related services); (ii) to understand your needs, provide you with a better service, and respond to your inquiries; (iii) for internal record keeping; (iv) for internal analysis; and (v) to administer promotions, services, and offers for which you provided Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information. Subject to the provisions below, we may also use this information for other marketing-related purposes. With respect to Application Information: (i) <u>Scholarship Applications and Related Materials</u>. As part of the application process, the Foundation requires prospective applicants, their parents/legal guardians and third parties (e.g., school officials) to provide information such as name, address, date of birth, telephone number, email address and/or other Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. The Foundation collects this information in order to contact prospective applicants and/or their parents/legal guardians, and to evaluate whether an applicant will receive any scholarship funds. This data may be collected via the online application system. Access to system information is restricted to the Program Administrators, current Foundation personnel and designated third party contractors and evaluators responsible for administrative matters associated with the scholarship program (e.g., reviewing and accessing submitted applications). Application Information submitted on certain forms may be shared with affiliated businesses and companies (and their designated employees) of the Foundation (which includes divisions and subsidiaries of Brunswick Corporation) solely to assess a scholarship application (e.g., Employee Verification Forms sent to the Human Resources Department to verify employment of applicant&#x27;s parent/legal guardian). For those third-party individuals who are assisting in the selection process, all copies of documents are removed by Foundation personnel (and/or their designees) and copies destroyed after they complete their service to the Foundation.  To the extent that you provide us with certain Personal Information through other means (e.g., you send us an email inquiry about the program and your inquiry contains your complete name, email address and date of birth), such information is not subject to this paragraph (i) and paragraph (ii) of the Privacy Policy governing &quot;Application Information.&quot; Nothing herein shall restrict the Foundation&#x27;s ability to maintain records, summaries and analysis of Application Information. (ii) <u>Scholarship Recipients</u>. The Foundation retains the application forms of students selected as scholarship recipients. We may also retain information on all applicants regardless of whether scholarship funds were received or not received.  This data remains on program servers and is accessible only to Program Administrators and/or their designees unless, in its sole discretion, decides to destroy such information.  The name, brief biography, one or more photographs/images/likenesses, and/or educational institutions attended by each scholarship recipient may, in the Foundation&#x27;s sole discretion, be used in press releases, posted on websites and/or released through other media outlets. Subject to the restrictions above (which apply only to Application Information), we may share your Personal Information with our affiliates or with unrelated third parties (including contractors who provide services to us) to assist with any of the uses of Personal and Non-Personal Information described herein.
